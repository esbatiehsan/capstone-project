# capstone-project
GA DSI capstone project - predicting delays based on flight and weather features.

A five-week individual machine learning project. Row data was acquired using the APIs provided by the US National Climatic Data Center and the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics for the years 2017 to 2019. The data consisted of the information related to more than ten million domestic flights from the twenty busiest airports in the United States and the hourly weather reports from the same locations. Once the initial cleaning and exploration was carried out, a VotingClassifier was trained on a subset of the data in order to predict flight status based on previously unseen weather and flight features.
