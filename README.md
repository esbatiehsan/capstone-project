# Data Science Immersive Capstone Project - General Assembly
This project was the main requirement for the successful completion of the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly London.

## Predicting Delay Based on Flight and Weather Features
Air travel is an indispensable feature of the modern world. It permeates our economic, social, and leisure activities. It connects us on a national, regional, and global scale. It generates trade, creates employment opportunities, and expedites tourism. Given this central and consequential role, any disruption can have major impacts. For example, the Federal Aviation Authority reported that disruptions caused by flight delays had cost the US economy $33 billion in 2019 alone.

The aim of this project is to use the dat provided by different authorities in the United States to provide a model that would enable different stakeholders, including passengers, and airline and airpot operators to predict possible flight delays and implement measures that would either eliminate the possibility of such delays or alleviate the effects.
