# Data Source and Dictionary

### Data Source
The majority of data used in this project was acquired from two separate sources.

National Climatic Data Center was the source of hourly weather data. This [dataset](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00532/html) can be accessed for different stations via the official API.
